 We are a team of legal Practitioners and training experts with over 8 years
cumulative experience in pro bono publico. We are committed to using our
skills and professional values to serve the public good. Pro bono Legal
Assistance Initiative started in 2013 but began as a Non-Governmental
Organisation in 2018 borne out of passion to render free legal services to prison
inmates who have no financial capacity to engage the services of legal
practitioners. Over the years,we have assisted prison inmates in over 70 legal
matters. Many of them have been discharged and acquitted, reunited with their
families, and empowered to be financially independent through skills
acquisition and trainings.PLAIN began in 2013 but became established as a corporate entity in 2018
with the aim of providing legal services without compensation or the
expectation of compensation from awaiting trial prison inmates. Our project is
driven by a team of legal and project management experts with over 8 years
cumulative experience in law and business management.
